## A system for valuing Halloween candy

When trading Halloween candy, it is useful to have a system for valuing each item numerically. Each candy can be given a value, in Calules, by finding its types, rareness, and size.
A candy item's final value is the average of its types, plus its rareness, plus its size. There is a standard value for each type, size, and rareness,  but one can make a personilzed chart based on their tastes.
In the case of a personalized chart, instead of the average of an item's types, one can use the highest valued type.

The types are:
* Peanut (100)
* Caramel (90)
* Chocolate (80)
* Hard (70)
* Sour (60)
* Minty (50)
* Fruit (40)
* Chewy (30)
* Gummy (20)
* Spicy (10)
* Savor (0)

The rarenesses are:
* Common (0)
* Uncommon (10)
* Infrequent (20)
* Rare (30)
* Scarce (40)

The sizes are:
* Small (0)
* Fun (10)
* Regular (20)
* Large (30)
* King (40) 
The size of a candy is determined by comparing it to standard candy bars, such as Snickers or Milky Way.

# OMUS Card Divination System
## OCDS
Tarot card meanings are hard to remember because there are so many, so here is a way to do divination with regular playing cards. Draw a card and use the suit and the number to find out what it means. You can ask a specific question, but it works better to ask about a general topic, like “family”.
## Suits:
* Hearts
  * Good
* Diamonds
  * Good, could change
* Spades
  * Bad
* Clubs
  * Bad, could change
## Numbers:
* Ace: Betrayal
* 2: Showing of trust, opposite of betrayal
* 3: Gift
* 4: Losing something, opposite of gift
* 5: Beginning
* 6: Ending
* 7: Both, beginning and ending
* 8: Close call
* 9: Quick thing
* 10: Long thing
* Jack: Surprise, unexpected thing
* Queen: Large change
* King: Very, very important thing
* Joker: Try again later, or the answer is unclear.

## Some sets of cards:
* The relationship set:
  * Draw three cards.
  * The first for relationships with friends
  * The second for relationships with family
  * The third for romantic relationships
* The yes or no question set:
  * Ask a yes or no question
  * Draw one card
  * If it is red, yes
  * If it is black, no
* The topic set:
  * Ask about a general topic, like “family”, or “the weather”
  * Draw one card
  * That card represents the state of the topic asked about.

# OMUS Library Organization System
## OLOS
### əʊ.ləʊs
OLOS is a system for sorting library books into categories, thus allowing one to organize them by topic. Each book’s label can be a combination of categories, categories sorted alphabetically, with periods between them. A category consists of at most three layers.
The kinds of layers are:
* Main
* Sub
* Specific

Every Main layer contains some Sub layers, each of which contains some Specific layers. A category consists of the letter code for a Main layer, then a Sub layer in that Main layer, then a Specific layer in that Sub layer. The Sub and Specific can be left out for a more general category.

## Examples:
* A book about German paintings could be labelled "AGD.GCE.GSeC", showing it is about drawings (paintings, specifically) from a European country
* A book about the history of algebra could be labelled "GStH.ScMAl".

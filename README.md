# OMUS
## The Organization for Mostly Unnecessary Specifications
### əʊ.mɪs. 
Most of the specifications OMUS creates fall into one of two categories:
* There are already perfectly good specifications for the same thing
* There is no reason for this to have a specification at all

And so, most OMUS specifications are unnecessary. 
All OMUS specifications, however, do fall into one category: none of them are official. Nobody uses these specifications for anything important, and you should not change this. These specifications are created for fun, and nothing more.

# OMUS
## The Organization for Mostly Unnecessary Standards
### əʊ.mɪs. 
Most of the standards OMUS creates fall into one of two categories:
* There are already perfectly good standards for the same thing
* There is no reason for this to have a standard at all

And so, most OMUS standards are unnecessary. 
All OMUS standards, however, do fall into one category: none of them are official. Nobody uses these standards for anything important, and you should not change this. These standards are created for fun, and nothing more.
